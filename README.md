# Blog du Yax

This blog is built on excellent work performed by fspaolo with [Makesite.py](https://github.com/fspaolo/makesite). 
I cut some features and wristed the code to focus on blog posts and support my [commenting system](https://github.com/kianby/stacosys). You should check fspaolo's repository to really understand Makesite.py's philosophy and get technical details.
