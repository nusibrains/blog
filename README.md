# Blog du Yax

This blog is built on excellent work performed by fspaolo on [Makesite.py](https://github.com/fspaolo/makesite). 
I cut some features and adapted the code to handle blog posts and to support my [commenting system](https://github.com/kianby/stacosys). You should check fspaolo's repository to understand Makesite.py's philosophy and get technical details.
