# Blog du Yax

This blog is built on excellent work performed by fspaolo on [Makesite.py](https://github.com/fspaolo/makesite). 
I have cut some features and adapted the code for handling blog posts and my commenting system. You should check fspaolo's repository to get technical details on Makesite.py.
